Recovery
After a deadlock was detected, the system needs to be recovered. 
There are three ways of recovery, but they are not very efficient 
in dealing with deadlocks. 
Those are recovery by preemption, rollback and killing processes.

Preemption is used when a resources can be taken temporarily from a process. 

Rollback implements checkpoints for processes. Checkpoints are periodically 
written to a file storing the memory image and the resources state.

Killing a processes implies that processes causing a deadlock will be killed

Avoidance
Deadlock avoidance is a method when the system decides whether granting 
resources is safe or not, and grants them only if it decides that it is safe.
Unfortunately, deadlock avoidance is not not always possible to be implemented,
because it requires information about future requests. 

Prevention
As stated in the name, this method strives to prevent the occurrence of a deadlock,
by dealing with the conditions under which they happen. So far, this is the most 
efficient method among the three stated.
